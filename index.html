		<time>06 July 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>When I first started this blog I wanted to write a bit about the Chicago DBC as a whole, because when I got accepted they hadnt even opened their doors for the Squirrels yet ( first cohort ). So unlike the DBC in San Francisco you couldnt look up anything you wanted about the place and have a ton of sources of info. So I kinda wanted to do that for DBC Chicago, even though no one reads this, maybe someone looking for answers will find it, and it will be helpful.</p>

<h4>Food &amp;&amp; Drink</h4>

<p>A lot of people go out to eat at lunch, you have a hour and a half.During Week 1 I ate out almost every day for lunch and dinner and was feeling pretty shitty so now I am trying to bring food or go back to my apartment and eat but its cool to try to places. There is a fridge for boots and each boot has a box for other food.</p>

<p>Merchandise Mart is just across the street, and they have a pretty good selection of things.</p>

<p>There is 2 Subways within a block and beyond that there is quite a large selection.</p>

<p>In the Kitchen at DBC there is 2 coffee makers, 1 of which is a Keurig, so bring your cup things if you want that, I havent used either but there is almost always coffee available, before 3 I think.</p>

<p>There is also a Starbucks in the main floor of the building and a CVS right across the street for other drinks or snacks.</p>

<p>Also theres a bar / burger place on the main floor but the 1 time I went there because I wanted a burger they were out of burgers, so I no longer will go there.</p>

<h4>Apartments / Housing</h4>

<p>I was really lucky and ended up getting a apartment a block away from DBC with a fellow Grasshopper, and honestly, its awesome. Its not overly expensive and the convience of living so close is worth any extra to me. Also Trader Joes and Whole Foods arent that far away which is pretty nice for groceries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rivernorthpark.com/">http://www.rivernorthpark.com/</a></p>

<p>Besides that I guess I would just check for sublets on craigslist or something, I think some other guys are trying to get a list together of places near by so I will link to that in the future if it happens.</p>

<h4>Hours?</h4>

<p>The core hours are 8 to 5 ( you check in with your group at 7:45 ) after that you are free to leave but its a great work enviroment, everyone is super helpful, and you will have stuff to do.</p>

<p>I usually get there at about 7:30ish and leave around 10ish sometimes later, depending if I have to get groceries or do laundry.</p>

<p>Weekends are optional but you still have work to do so if you dont come in you will still have to put in some good hours of work. Weekends get a little louder than core hours during the week so I suggest headphones if you need the quiet.</p>

<h4>Work Enviroment</h4>

<p>This is my favorite part about DBC, its a great place to work and everyone is amazing. I have never felt so excited to go somewhere at 7:30 in the morning. Its pretty cool to think that, at any given minute in that place, someone is making something awesome.</p>

<p>Originally I kinda figured it would be wierd, being the n00bs in phase 1 but everyone has been there and everyone is super helpful.</p>

<p>If anyone has any questions you can feel free to email me @ <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#122;&#109;&#111;&#108;&#97;&#x75;&#115;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#x7a;&#x6d;&#111;&#x6c;&#97;&#117;&#x73;&#111;&#110;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> and in my INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF FREE TIME I will get back to you.</p>

			<p>Well it appears I finally figured out how to get my posts to not have a title.</p>

<p>I just have to rake new post with a title ( currently using the date ) and then just replaces the title with a space, you have to leave the title tag and put a space otherwise it defaults to your file name.</p>

<p>We are only about a week away from Phase 2, I am feeling really good about Phase 1 but I wont know until Thursday. Alyssa said that if they havent mentioned to us that we are in danger of &ldquo;failing&rdquo; then we are all good, but I guess I like to worry.</p>

			<p>Im so exhausted today, luckily the flash cards exercise for today doesnt seem too complex, and I think its a group project so that will be cool.</p>

<p>Im really hoping we dont get stuck in a super boring lecture today, I really wish they could be optional, I dont like wasteing time when only a few people cant get it.</p>

<p>Also testing another no title post.</p>

			<p>So because the whole title situation has really been holding me back from blogging I am going to try to just not have a title on all my blogs, if it doesnt work Ill just use the date but Id rather just use nothing, maybe throw the date in the tags.</p>

<p>Also it appears I fixed the twitter queue issue.</p>

			<p>Well today is July 4th. Got up at 6:30 and was at DBC at 7 this morning, a hour earlier than I usually am. Feeling pretty tired already but I feel like I have got quite a bit accomplished. Micah, Brett, and I were planning on grilling some steaks tonight but the courtyard at the apartment has been pretty packed today, and last I was at the apartment there was a pretty good sized beer pong game going, so we may just be cooking some steaks on the grill.</p>

<p>We also went to Trader Joes today and got some stuff, Im hoping to not have lunch and dinner out as much, I am really getting sick of that kind of food. I really enjoy trying to places around the city but not every day.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have another group project day and then on the weekend the cores revolve mostly around Databases which I am really looking forward to. I really cant believe we are only a week from Phase 2.</p>

<p>I already started looking into sinatra, it seems pretty simple. I just need to brush up on my HTML and CSS a bit and then I should be good to take in a massive amount of Javascript and Sinatra. I am kinda of worried about Javascript because all the times I have tried to learn it, it was a real bitch.</p>

<p>Today I started writing my github project landing page, using Sinatra of course, figured I might as well just through myself into it and see what happens.</p>

<p>I attempted to fix the twitter issue, I kept getting the same tweet every deploy which I really dont understand, I emptied my twitter queue after finally figuring out how to empty it.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>I want to try to write a new one of these every morning, and I usually have time. I can never think of a title though, maybe starting tomorrow I will just put the date, or give it a title then remove it before I post, I have to write something when I create the post because thats how its stored date-time-title.md</p>

<p>I slept so good last night except I woke up more tired that I have ever work up since I got here. This post will probably just random thoughts put together in no order or maybe not even appear to be english.</p>

<p>Today we are doing &ldquo;fireside&rdquo; chats on our portfolios and last night I finished up my portfolios so I am feeling pretty good about that.
Also we get to scrape hackernews as a core so that should be pretty awesome, hopefully theres some stuff not about snowden or prism so whatever we scrape isnt stupid.</p>

<p>This morning I figured out my dropbox was constantly synching everyone in my cohorts dropbox folder along with mine so that was destroying my battery life.</p>

		<time>02 July 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>So week one was nuts. Not as extreme of a workload as I expected, but theres always been something to be done. Week 2 is Object Oriented Programming, which I am really looking forward to. Im not super good with classes but I have a pretty good understanding so hopefully I get paired today with someone who can explain it a little more as we work.</p>

<p>Yesterday we did Engineering Empathy, which I didnt hate, but its certainly not part of what I am used to, but I have been trying to get out of my comfort zone while I am here so that certainly did it.</p>

<p>Also yesterday we had Improv night, which was also nuts. That also got me out of my comfort zone. The instructor was very nice and he had us doing cool stuff, I just wasnt into it. I much rather would have been coding for that 3 hours but I get why they have us do it, so thats cool.</p>

<p>I got thinking yesterday about some cool shit I could build in Sinatra, even though I dont know Sinatra, but in my spare time these next two weeks I could probably learn Sinatra.</p>

<p>I would like to explore the idea of building the following:</p>

<p>Cards Against Humanity
Online version of our chatroom</p>

<p>And I had a few more ideas but of course I cant think of them&hellip;</p>

<p>I dont want to spend too much time doing that though because if I have extra time I should be helping others who are having a more difficult time with the material we are covering, not only because I want them to succeed but also it will help me understand the concepts I am trying to explain. Also I want to make sure I have a pretty good understanding before I try to explain something because I would hate to explain something wrong and them think its right from now on.</p>

		<time>28 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I feel like week one is going really well so far. Today we are tackling Sudoku which I dont currently have any ideas for but we have about a hour until that would be a issue anyways. Yesterday Ryan and I paired and we got a lot of work done and solved some cool problems, which was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The speaker last night was incredible. Hands down my favorite speaker Ive ever heard. He was funny and he was talking about topics we all cared about, which was awesome. He was the lead ( I think ) for the Mozilla Badges project and really gave me a lot to think about. He never stayed at a single job for more than 2 years, just because the job he was at wouldnt let him try to technologies, or old, that he wanted to play with learn, which is awesome that he just was learning so much.</p>

<p>&mdash;&ndash; Im going to continue this post today (Saturday, didnt get a chance to finish yesterday &mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p>Yesterday was one one of my least favorite days in my recent memory. We did a Sudoku solver as a group and our group dynamic did not work. I was so mentaly, just dead, I left right at 5 and just went to lay down for a bit. I couldnt even think.</p>

<p>Today, I am going to work on the weekend cores, which there isnt a whole lot then I am going to try to work on the chat app that Brett and I built last Sunday.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/blog/2013/06/25/day-2-pair-programming-slash/">Day 2: Pair Programming, Mentors, and Badassery</a></h1>
		<time>25 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Today was my second day at DevBootcamp in Chicago. It was simply awesome.</p>

<h4>Pairing</h4>

<p>We paired with the same person all day today and my pair ended up being Brett, and the pair programming experience was really good. I just kept my hands away from the keyboard and mouse while navigating so I wouldnt accidently take control when my brain started going, and when I did take over, I asked first so I wasnt stepping on any toes.</p>

<h4>Mentors</h4>

<p>We met our mentors tonight, my mentor is Rob Lambert, who is a java developer. I&rsquo;m not sure what mentors provide to us, but its cool that people are willing to give up some of their day to help us beginners out.</p>

<h4>A Bit of Badassery</h4>

<p>Today was pretty badass, since Brett and I were pretty productive we had a bit of extra time so I helped some people out, which was really cool to be able to help others instead of only asking for help, which we also had to do because regular expressions are crazy.</p>

		<time>24 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>So.. Pair Programming.</p>

<p>Today was my first real shot at it. Im not sure what to think of it, but I am sure that if we are learning how to do it properly, its good.
I thought it was pretty good, at some points and it was mostly dependant on who I was pairing with. Some people it really was pretty good, but then a couple it was just eh, and I dont blame anyone but myself.</p>

<p>I am so used to working on my own and in my own little zone, when I see a possibility of improving the code or something I just jump on the keyboard and starting layin down code. Which certainly isnt how pair programming works.</p>

<p>Ill keep posting on pair programming as I get better / or worse at it. I would really like to get really understand, sooner than later, so I dont hurt my partners learning while pairing, but for now we are all new to it.</p>
