			<p>So tomorrow&rsquo;s the day that will be the beginning of my time at DevBootcamp. I&rsquo;m so excited and nervous at the same time I am not sure what to even say about it.  I went to dinner tonight with ~10 of the people in my cohort (The Grasshoppers) which was fun.</p>

<p>Also today, which I am pretty proud of / excited about, Brett and I made a chat client created in Ruby using a service called PubNub for instant updating. Its coming a long pretty nicely, and we only have a few hours into which is unbelievable to me. We havent really been pair programming because we have been using both our computers but working a long side each other, which has really sped up everything we have been working on so far. We also uploaded it to github and we are going to give version control a try, instead of just sharing gists to keep each other on the same path.</p>

<p>You can check that out here :
<a href="https://github.com/zacholauson/pubnub_chatroom">https://github.com/zacholauson/pubnub_chatroom</a></p>

<p>Here is his github page:
<a href="https://github.com/brettsanders">https://github.com/brettsanders</a></p>

<p>We have to be there at 7:50 and the doors open at 8, we got a email from Dave (Dave Hoover) on Saturday letting us know what to do, and it really didnt answer a whole lot, which I know it wasnt supposed to.</p>

<p>Anyways, as I was told to, to my family &amp;&amp; friends:</p>

<p>  &ldquo;I am moving to Nepal to find inner piece.
   I like a few of you. That is all.</p>

			<p>This morning my mom was driving through Chicago so I went and had breakfast with her, and then coded a bit, then Brett and I decided to go get groceries and we ended up exploring Chicago a bit, we went to the top of the John Hancock building and took some cool pictures, I played around with Photosphere and then we went and looked at some beautiful cars at a, dare I say, Super / Hyper Car dealership. Cars are so beautiful, even the shitty ones still have a little something that makes them nice. Not sure if I should admit I feel that way though, some cars are so ugly.</p>

<p>Tonight we are working on making that One &ndash; Dice &ndash; Roll game multiplayer in the sense that you could controll it from 2 or more different computers, we started with sockets but we cant get it to communicate properly.</p>

<p>I suggested we set up something like port forwarding so we could use external IP&rsquo;s to connect to each other, and I think that would work, but we arent getting it.</p>

<p>So now were kinda reverse engineering multiplayer games built in Ruby to figure out what makes a server and client app communicate.</p>

<p>Also just over 1 day until DevBootcamp starts.</p>

<p>We so excited and it ain&rsquo;t even Friday.</p>

			<p>Well we are only 2 days away from starting DevBootcamp. I am feeling much better about where I am, and I think I am pretty well prepared, only time will tell though.</p>

<p>Last night, Brett (who is my roomate and also a Grasshopper) and I were working on a One Die Game from rubyquiz, we ended up using Nitrous.IO to collaborate over a couple text files and we made a lot of progress last night. We still need to implement computer logic so you can play against AI. We also took it a step further and starting making it so you could specify who many players you wanted and how many of them would be humans, so you could play against 20+ computers (probably wouldnt be very fun) or play vs a friend or something.</p>

			<p>Alright everything seemed to work except for the link to the blog post, I think it was getting thrown off because I have it on a github project page called /blog and individual posts are also stored in /blog folder when deployed so its:</p>

<p>zacholauson.github.io/blog/blog/#{post_name}</p>

<p>It should work now assuming I understand the code correctly.</p>

			<p>I wanted to set up something that would tweet when I posted a new post on here and ended up finding this:</p>

<p><a href="http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/13/howto-tweet-new-posts-in-octopress/">http://fusion94.org/blog/2013/01/13/howto-tweet-new-posts-in-octopress/</a></p>

<p>Assuming this post generates &amp;&amp; deploys and sends out a tweet, I think its pretty awesome. If anyone else is using octopress ( which I recommend you do ) this could come in handy if you are also wanting to do something similar.</p>

<p>It was pretty straightforward, I did get caught up on the dev.twitter page trying to get my tokens generated but not a big problem.</p>

<p>Here goes nothing&hellip;</p>

		<time>21 June 2013</time>

		<div class="content">
			<p>Only 3 more days until my start at DBC. Im nervous, but not like a nervous that I may do bad, more like a excited nervous, because I am only 3 days away from being dunked into a tank of knowledge.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I was able to find a place like DevBootcamp, last year after I finished high school I was looking all over for web development programs and more traditional colleges. I visited RMCAD in Denver, CO and that was a really cool school but it was more art than development, which if I were to go somewhere for traditional design and art that is where I would go, it was amazing. But I want to code. I also looked at Computer Science Degrees and wasnt really sold on them.</p>

<p>Then about 3 months ago I was reading CPU Magazine and in the very back there was a short article about DevBootcamp, I barely started reading the article and instantly knew I wanted to go there, and now here I am.</p>

<p>Im going to try to start a pattern of when I blog so I force myself to do it everyday so I can write things about what I am learning and help myself remember and also, mark my progress, so in the future I can look back and see how I progressed.</p>

		<time>20 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>My DevBootcamp experience starts in just over 4 days, and I am getting pretty nervous. I feel like I am ready but I really dont know. I am going to the DBC office tonight for speaker night, which should be awesome as usual. Ive been reading a book called Creating Command Line Applications in Ruby ( I think thats right ) which has been pretty cool, Im not sure how useful it will be but Ive been just reading it along Well Grounded Rubyist which I am sure will be useful because Ive heard people mention how good it is.</p>

<p>Ive also been struggling with internet in the apartment, I bought a ClearWire hotspot last week when I moved here and at some times its awesome but usually its not, which is my biggest problem with it, if it was always shitty that would be fine I guess because I just need it for downloading files and reading but sometimes its really good. When its really good I get the smart idea to stream some music or a movie while I am working then it takes a shit again and it just pisses me off. I decided to just tether off my phone, its not real fast but its consistant. So last night I call up ClearWire to cancel and some &ldquo;internet expert&rdquo; attempts to fix it, then blames the inconsistant internet on me not shutting down the hotspot. How am I supposed to use the internet if its shut down? The greatest thing during the whole conversation is when I learned that I&rsquo;ve used over 40GB of data in just over a week, I was quite impressed seeing how I hadnt downloaded anything significant, just a few ebooks. Pretty nuts.</p>

		<time>13 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Last night I went to Ruby Hack Night, which was hosted by Enova, with Micah and Priya from DBC, it was pretty awesome. I got to try out Pair Programming, which I still dont fully get but it was pretty cool. We built a JSON oranizer, my partner knew much more than me and proposed we do it with RSPEC which turned out pretty cool. I had only used RSPEC one other time and it was during the Hartl tutorial, but I really didnt understand it too well. I think I get it a little more now.</p>

<p>Tonight I am going to DBC for the Thursday Speaker Night, the speaker is Eric Lunt who is the CTO of BrightTag, which Im not entirely sure what it does but Im sure Ill understand more after tonight.</p>

			<p>Got moved into my apartment in Chicago, and have been coding as much as possible. Micah, from my DBC cohort, lives in the same building so I have been working with him a bit.
I also went to Coding Coffee, which was pretty cool, got a bit done on my Imgur / Reddit scraper, and had some shitty Starbucks coffee.
Its been really hot here, which I dont mind so much but its also been extremely humid, which I really dont like, luckily the apartment has really good AC.</p>

		<time>07 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<h3>Today I talked to Stephen Nguyen, who is in Phase 4 at DBC. He was doing a Google Hangout where anyone could come in and ask questions or just hangout.</h3>

<h3>Heres his blog if you wish to check it out <a href="http://binaryskipper.tumblr.com/">http://binaryskipper.tumblr.com/</a></h3>

<p>So I didnt go in with any specific questions, just thought I would hangout and hopefully chat about code. He gave me some pretty cool info about some plugins for Sublime, such as Bracket Highlighter, Emmet, and SublimeLinter, which all can be found in Package Control.</p>

<p>He also gave me some tips on getting even more prepared for DBC. He said there were some books I should probably check out like &ldquo;Eloquent Ruby&rdquo; (which I have been reading and its awesome), &ldquo;Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sinatra Up and Running&rdquo;. He also said that doing the exercises in Chris Pine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Learn to Program&rdquo; was very important, he said many people just read through the book and didnt really get all they could take away from the book, he said a lot of the Exercises are similar or the same as their Week 1 challenges, which I am not sure if SF and Chicagos exercises are the same but still good info.</p>

<p>Also he recommended to play around with SQL tables, and play around with Sinatra and Rails, although we wont need Rails until Phase 3 but it would be good to be somewhat familiar.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;m thankful he took the time out of his day to do this for the DBC community, he gave me a lot of helpful tips and I feel a little bit better about were I am in prep.</p>
