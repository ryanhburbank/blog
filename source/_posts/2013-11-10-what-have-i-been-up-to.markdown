I don't think very many people followed my past blog posts, and if they did they were more than likely underwhelmed. I don't feel like I put very much effort into my posts and thats why I stopped blogging.

Lets start from the beginning:

My name is Zach Olauson. I love to code. 

About 9 months ago while looking for a college to attend after high school, I stumbled upon Dev Bootcamp. You have more than likely heard of Dev Bootcamp and know what it is all about, but if you haven't, Dev Bootcamp is a web development training program in which you are taught Ruby, Sinatra, Javascript, Rails, and a bunch of other technologies. When I signed up for Dev Bootcamp thats all I thought it was, learning new technologies and then going home. I was very wrong. I learned a lot of tech skills while at Dev Bootcamp but I feel like the most valuable thing I learned at Dev Bootcamp was how to learn. We all learn differently and that is apparent at Dev Bootcamp. I learned that jumping head first into a problem is a great way to learn. So thats what I did during my time at Dev Bootcamp, try new things without thinking to get the most out of it. It was great.

I have been done with Dev Bootcamp for maybe 3 months or so now. Its been pretty weird, and I am bored a lot now. While at DBC you worked non stop all day, and I mean all day. I have way too much free time now and I am trying to fill it the best I can but it feels weird.

I code pretty much every day, but a few days ago I realized that most of my commits for the past month or so have been in private repos and they don't show up on my public page on Github. I have decided to put more work into work I can actually show, so I decided I will commit at least once, preferably much more, every day to a public repo. I would also like to get to the point where I write at least one blog post a week but baby steps. 

This week has been the main start of my commit every day streak and I have been having a great time. Last weekend I rebuilt Longify, which is basically bit.ly but it makes your urls much longer, my mentor Abraham Sangha and I built a version of it while at Dev Bootcamp and had a blast so I decided to rebuild it in rails and deploy it. Check it out [here](http://longify.zacholauson.io/).

Well I just noticed I wrote a lot very quickly so instead of blowing all my thoughts on this post, I think I will slowly let my mind spill onto the internet. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
