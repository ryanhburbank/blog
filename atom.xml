			<![CDATA[<p>I have written so many posts lately but didnt finish them.
Im in Phase 2 now, its&hellip; incredible. Phase 1 was relatively fun, but Phase 2, holy shit, its great.</p>

<p>Monday the Dragonflies came in and they all seem really smart, Im not sure what happened between us and them but we definently had some really weak links and they seem to all be doing quite good. I am a little nervous about pairing is caring this weekend because I have a feeling I might look like a giant dumbass while attempting to help, oh well.</p>

<p>Monday night I ended up building a Katy Perry Lorem Ipsum Generator for Mike, one of the instructors, and then Tuesday I had a finished sinatra web app running on Heroku, its so cool being able to pass around a link of something you built, even though its somewhat useless, except for yesterday we used it to seed a blog system we made, which made it quite interesting. I dont think you can imagine how strange and inappropriate her lyrics are until you take thousands of lines of them and mix them together randomly, it crazy.</p>

<p>Wednesday we started AJAX, I think, could have been Tuesday, but who cares. I am so lost with javascript, I dont even know what to do, I have been doing the CodeSchool jQuery tutorial and it seems to be helping a bit but I still dont think I can write anything with it,  but I can read it pretty well.</p>

<h2>Still havent finished this one but working on updating things.</h2>

			<![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we started Phase 2, and its super fuckin badass. We are making websites with sinatra already, they arent super complex but being able make something sweet looking as well as functional after spending a shit load of time making command line apps, its pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Also we started using PostgreSQL and did a couple database seeds that took 15+ minutes, which while it was way too long, it was still awesome to see all the data being pushed into a database.</p>

<p>The Dragonflies started yesterday and they seem to be doing quite well. One pair was already doing Battleship which I dont think anyone in THE PLAGUE* had done on the first day.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>We are nearing the end of Phase 1, and I am moving ahead to Phase 2 Monday.</p>

<p>I am so pumped.</p>

<p>It sounds like we lost a few people which is too. I expected we would lose a few people and to be honest I kinda expected we would lose more but I am glad people we able to make it.</p>

<p>Tonight we had the creator of Selenium for speaker night which was pretty cool. He talked a lot about the robot he made that could manually test iOS and Android apps on actual devices, which is pretty awesome.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Today is the beginning of week 3 in Phase 1. We are supposed to be learning Databases and Active Record, and I am pretty excited about that.</p>

<p>Update on Week 3 Phase 1:</p>

<p>We have looked at Databases and Active Record a bit but not a whole log. SQL queries are pretty fun and now we have been implementing them into ruby programs which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Today was the assessment to see if we move on to Phase 2, and I made it. I was super nervous last night even though I didnt feel like I had a reason to, I also interviewed with Mike which was pretty cool, he questioned a lot of my code and even though it really put me on the spot I really appreciated it.</p>

<p>Im looking forward to Phase 2 so much, I just wanna build awesome shit every day.</p>

		<content type="html">
			<![CDATA[
				
					<p></p>
				
			]]>
			<![CDATA[<p>When I first started this blog I wanted to write a bit about the Chicago DBC as a whole, because when I got accepted they hadnt even opened their doors for the Squirrels yet ( first cohort ). So unlike the DBC in San Francisco you couldnt look up anything you wanted about the place and have a ton of sources of info. So I kinda wanted to do that for DBC Chicago, even though no one reads this, maybe someone looking for answers will find it, and it will be helpful.</p>

<h4>Food &amp;&amp; Drink</h4>

<p>A lot of people go out to eat at lunch, you have a hour and a half.During Week 1 I ate out almost every day for lunch and dinner and was feeling pretty shitty so now I am trying to bring food or go back to my apartment and eat but its cool to try to places. There is a fridge for boots and each boot has a box for other food.</p>

<p>Merchandise Mart is just across the street, and they have a pretty good selection of things.</p>

<p>There is 2 Subways within a block and beyond that there is quite a large selection.</p>

<p>In the Kitchen at DBC there is 2 coffee makers, 1 of which is a Keurig, so bring your cup things if you want that, I havent used either but there is almost always coffee available, before 3 I think.</p>

<p>There is also a Starbucks in the main floor of the building and a CVS right across the street for other drinks or snacks.</p>

<p>Also theres a bar / burger place on the main floor but the 1 time I went there because I wanted a burger they were out of burgers, so I no longer will go there.</p>

<h4>Apartments / Housing</h4>

<p>I was really lucky and ended up getting a apartment a block away from DBC with a fellow Grasshopper, and honestly, its awesome. Its not overly expensive and the convience of living so close is worth any extra to me. Also Trader Joes and Whole Foods arent that far away which is pretty nice for groceries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rivernorthpark.com/">http://www.rivernorthpark.com/</a></p>

<p>Besides that I guess I would just check for sublets on craigslist or something, I think some other guys are trying to get a list together of places near by so I will link to that in the future if it happens.</p>

<h4>Hours?</h4>

<p>The core hours are 8 to 5 ( you check in with your group at 7:45 ) after that you are free to leave but its a great work enviroment, everyone is super helpful, and you will have stuff to do.</p>

<p>I usually get there at about 7:30ish and leave around 10ish sometimes later, depending if I have to get groceries or do laundry.</p>

<p>Weekends are optional but you still have work to do so if you dont come in you will still have to put in some good hours of work. Weekends get a little louder than core hours during the week so I suggest headphones if you need the quiet.</p>

<h4>Work Enviroment</h4>

<p>This is my favorite part about DBC, its a great place to work and everyone is amazing. I have never felt so excited to go somewhere at 7:30 in the morning. Its pretty cool to think that, at any given minute in that place, someone is making something awesome.</p>

<p>Originally I kinda figured it would be wierd, being the n00bs in phase 1 but everyone has been there and everyone is super helpful.</p>

<p>If anyone has any questions you can feel free to email me @ <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#122;&#x6d;&#111;&#108;&#97;&#x75;&#115;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x7a;&#109;&#x6f;&#x6c;&#97;&#117;&#x73;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> and in my INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF FREE TIME I will get back to you.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Well it appears I finally figured out how to get my posts to not have a title.</p>

<p>I just have to rake new post with a title ( currently using the date ) and then just replaces the title with a space, you have to leave the title tag and put a space otherwise it defaults to your file name.</p>

<p>We are only about a week away from Phase 2, I am feeling really good about Phase 1 but I wont know until Thursday. Alyssa said that if they havent mentioned to us that we are in danger of &ldquo;failing&rdquo; then we are all good, but I guess I like to worry.</p>

<p>When I first started this blog I wanted to write a bit about the Chicago DBC as a whole, because when I got accepted they hadnt even opened their doors for the Squirrels yet ( first cohort ). So unlike the DBC in San Francisco you couldnt look up anything you wanted about the place and have a ton of sources of info.

			<![CDATA[<p>Well today is July 4th. Got up at 6:30 and was at DBC at 7 this morning, a hour earlier than I usually am. Feeling pretty tired already but I feel like I have got quite a bit accomplished. Micah, Brett, and I were planning on grilling some steaks tonight but the courtyard at the apartment has been pretty packed today, and last I was at the apartment there was a pretty good sized beer pong game going, so we may just be cooking some steaks on the grill.</p>

<p>We also went to Trader Joes today and got some stuff, Im hoping to not have lunch and dinner out as much, I am really getting sick of that kind of food. I really enjoy trying to places around the city but not every day.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have another group project day and then on the weekend the cores revolve mostly around Databases which I am really looking forward to. I really cant believe we are only a week from Phase 2.</p>

<p>I already started looking into sinatra, it seems pretty simple. I just need to brush up on my HTML and CSS a bit and then I should be good to take in a massive amount of Javascript and Sinatra. I am kinda of worried about Javascript because all the times I have tried to learn it, it was a real bitch.</p>

<p>Today I started writing my github project landing page, using Sinatra of course, figured I might as well just through myself into it and see what happens.</p>

<p>I attempted to fix the twitter issue, I kept getting the same tweet every deploy which I really dont understand, I emptied my twitter queue after finally figuring out how to empty it.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>I want to try to write a new one of these every morning, and I usually have time. I can never think of a title though, maybe starting tomorrow I will just put the date, or give it a title then remove it before I post, I have to write something when I create the post because thats how its stored date-time-title.md</p>

<p>I slept so good last night except I woke up more tired that I have ever work up since I got here. This post will probably just random thoughts put together in no order or maybe not even appear to be english.</p>

<p>Today we are doing &ldquo;fireside&rdquo; chats on our portfolios and last night I finished up my portfolios so I am feeling pretty good about that.
Also we get to scrape hackernews as a core so that should be pretty awesome, hopefully theres some stuff not about snowden or prism so whatever we scrape isnt stupid.</p>

<p>This morning I figured out my dropbox was constantly synching everyone in my cohorts dropbox folder along with mine so that was destroying my battery life.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>So week one was nuts. Not as extreme of a workload as I expected, but theres always been something to be done. Week 2 is Object Oriented Programming, which I am really looking forward to. Im not super good with classes but I have a pretty good understanding so hopefully I get paired today with someone who can explain it a little more as we work.</p>

<p>Yesterday we did Engineering Empathy, which I didnt hate, but its certainly not part of what I am used to, but I have been trying to get out of my comfort zone while I am here so that certainly did it.</p>

<p>Also yesterday we had Improv night, which was also nuts. That also got me out of my comfort zone. The instructor was very nice and he had us doing cool stuff, I just wasnt into it. I much rather would have been coding for that 3 hours but I get why they have us do it, so thats cool.</p>

<p>I got thinking yesterday about some cool shit I could build in Sinatra, even though I dont know Sinatra, but in my spare time these next two weeks I could probably learn Sinatra.</p>

<p>I would like to explore the idea of building the following:</p>

<p>Cards Against Humanity
Online version of our chatroom</p>

<p>And I had a few more ideas but of course I cant think of them&hellip;</p>

<p>I dont want to spend too much time doing that though because if I have extra time I should be helping others who are having a more difficult time with the material we are covering, not only because I want them to succeed but also it will help me understand the concepts I am trying to explain. Also I want to make sure I have a pretty good understanding before I try to explain something because I would hate to explain something wrong and them think its right from now on.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>I feel like week one is going really well so far. Today we are tackling Sudoku which I dont currently have any ideas for but we have about a hour until that would be a issue anyways. Yesterday Ryan and I paired and we got a lot of work done and solved some cool problems, which was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The speaker last night was incredible. Hands down my favorite speaker Ive ever heard. He was funny and he was talking about topics we all cared about, which was awesome. He was the lead ( I think ) for the Mozilla Badges project and really gave me a lot to think about. He never stayed at a single job for more than 2 years, just because the job he was at wouldnt let him try to technologies, or old, that he wanted to play with learn, which is awesome that he just was learning so much.</p>

<p>&mdash;&ndash; Im going to continue this post today (Saturday, didnt get a chance to finish yesterday &mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p>Yesterday was one one of my least favorite days in my recent memory. We did a Sudoku solver as a group and our group dynamic did not work. I was so mentaly, just dead, I left right at 5 and just went to lay down for a bit. I couldnt even think.</p>

<p>Today, I am going to work on the weekend cores, which there isnt a whole lot then I am going to try to work on the chat app that Brett and I built last Sunday.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Today was my second day at DevBootcamp in Chicago. It was simply awesome.</p>

<h4>Pairing</h4>

<p>We paired with the same person all day today and my pair ended up being Brett, and the pair programming experience was really good. I just kept my hands away from the keyboard and mouse while navigating so I wouldnt accidently take control when my brain started going, and when I did take over, I asked first so I wasnt stepping on any toes.</p>

<h4>Mentors</h4>

<p>We met our mentors tonight, my mentor is Rob Lambert, who is a java developer. I&rsquo;m not sure what mentors provide to us, but its cool that people are willing to give up some of their day to help us beginners out.</p>

<h4>A Bit of Badassery</h4>

<p>Today was pretty badass, since Brett and I were pretty productive we had a bit of extra time so I helped some people out, which was really cool to be able to help others instead of only asking for help, which we also had to do because regular expressions are crazy.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>So.. Pair Programming.</p>

<p>Today was my first real shot at it. Im not sure what to think of it, but I am sure that if we are learning how to do it properly, its good.
I thought it was pretty good, at some points and it was mostly dependant on who I was pairing with. Some people it really was pretty good, but then a couple it was just eh, and I dont blame anyone but myself.</p>

<p>I am so used to working on my own and in my own little zone, when I see a possibility of improving the code or something I just jump on the keyboard and starting layin down code. Which certainly isnt how pair programming works.</p>

<p>Ill keep posting on pair programming as I get better / or worse at it. I would really like to get really understand, sooner than later, so I dont hurt my partners learning while pairing, but for now we are all new to it.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>So today was my first day at DevBootcamp Chicago. I am not sure how to describe it, so Ill just use a single word: Badass. Everyone is super nice and so pumped to be here, its nuts.</p>

<p>This morning our group was welcomed by a man with a pretty cool mustache in short jean shorts and a guy in strobing sun glasses. It threw me off a bit.</p>

<p>Then when we walked into the front door, we walked through a tunnel of screaming people, one of the more terrifying moments of my life.</p>

<p>Most of the morning consisted of talks about what we will be doing and different stuff while we are here.</p>

<p>We did get to start a bit of coding today, which was fun, we got to do pair programming, which I am not so sure on, I will make a seperate post including my thoughts and whatnot on that as a beginner after I send this one out.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Well we are only about 30 minutes away from starting. I am not sure what to say, just I am excited and nervous and I cant wait to start diving into some code.</p>

<p>I am not sure if blogging counts as social networking while I am there, so I may just have to write a post tonight about all that I have learned.</p>

<p>As I get more used to the place I want to write about the experience at the Chicago office, because when I applied it hadnt even opened and I havent been able to find much info about it, where as the San Francisco office, you can pretty much find out whatever you want to know from a blog post or two.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>So tomorrow&rsquo;s the day that will be the beginning of my time at DevBootcamp. I&rsquo;m so excited and nervous at the same time I am not sure what to even say about it.  I went to dinner tonight with ~10 of the people in my cohort (The Grasshoppers) which was fun.</p>

<p>Also today, which I am pretty proud of / excited about, Brett and I made a chat client created in Ruby using a service called PubNub for instant updating. Its coming a long pretty nicely, and we only have a few hours into which is unbelievable to me. We havent really been pair programming because we have been using both our computers but working a long side each other, which has really sped up everything we have been working on so far. We also uploaded it to github and we are going to give version control a try, instead of just sharing gists to keep each other on the same path.</p>

<p>You can check that out here :
<a href="https://github.com/zacholauson/pubnub_chatroom">https://github.com/zacholauson/pubnub_chatroom</a></p>

<p>Here is his github page:
<a href="https://github.com/brettsanders">https://github.com/brettsanders</a></p>

<p>We have to be there at 7:50 and the doors open at 8, we got a email from Dave (Dave Hoover) on Saturday letting us know what to do, and it really didnt answer a whole lot, which I know it wasnt supposed to.</p>

<p>Anyways, as I was told to, to my family &amp;&amp; friends:</p>

<p>  &ldquo;I am moving to Nepal to find inner peace.
   I like a few of you. That is all.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>This morning my mom was driving through Chicago so I went and had breakfast with her, and then coded a bit, then Brett and I decided to go get groceries and we ended up exploring Chicago a bit, we went to the top of the John Hancock building and took some cool pictures, I played around with Photosphere and then we went and looked at some beautiful cars at a, dare I say, Super / Hyper Car dealership. Cars are so beautiful, even the shitty ones still have a little something that makes them nice. Not sure if I should admit I feel that way though, some cars are so ugly.</p>

<p>Tonight we are working on making that One &ndash; Dice &ndash; Roll game multiplayer in the sense that you could controll it from 2 or more different computers, we started with sockets but we cant get it to communicate properly.</p>

<p>I suggested we set up something like port forwarding so we could use external IP&rsquo;s to connect to each other, and I think that would work, but we arent getting it.</p>

<p>So now were kinda reverse engineering multiplayer games built in Ruby to figure out what makes a server and client app communicate.</p>

<p>Also just over 1 day until DevBootcamp starts.</p>

<p>We so excited and it ain&rsquo;t even Friday.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Well we are only 2 days away from starting DevBootcamp. I am feeling much better about where I am, and I think I am pretty well prepared, only time will tell though.</p>

<p>Last night, Brett (who is my roomate and also a Grasshopper) and I were working on a One Die Game from rubyquiz, we ended up using Nitrous.IO to collaborate over a couple text files and we made a lot of progress last night. We still need to implement computer logic so you can play against AI. We also took it a step further and starting making it so you could specify who many players you wanted and how many of them would be humans, so you could play against 20+ computers (probably wouldnt be very fun) or play vs a friend or something.</p>
