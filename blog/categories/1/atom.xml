    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So tomorrow&rsquo;s the day that will be the beginning of my time at DevBootcamp. I&rsquo;m so excited and nervous at the same time I am not sure what to even say about it.  I went to dinner tonight with ~10 of the people in my cohort (The Grasshoppers) which was fun.</p>

<p>Also today, which I am pretty proud of / excited about, Brett and I made a chat client created in Ruby using a service called PubNub for instant updating. Its coming a long pretty nicely, and we only have a few hours into which is unbelievable to me. We havent really been pair programming because we have been using both our computers but working a long side each other, which has really sped up everything we have been working on so far. We also uploaded it to github and we are going to give version control a try, instead of just sharing gists to keep each other on the same path.</p>

<p>You can check that out here :

<p>Here is his github page:

<p>We have to be there at 7:50 and the doors open at 8, we got a email from Dave (Dave Hoover) on Saturday letting us know what to do, and it really didnt answer a whole lot, which I know it wasnt supposed to.</p>

<p>Anyways, as I was told to, to my family &amp;&amp; friends:</p>

<p>  &ldquo;I am moving to Nepal to find inner piece.
   I like a few of you. That is all.</p>
