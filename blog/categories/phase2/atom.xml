    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we started Phase 2, and its super fuckin badass. We are making websites with sinatra already, they arent super complex but being able make something sweet looking as well as functional after spending a shit load of time making command line apps, its pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Also we started using PostgreSQL and did a couple database seeds that took 15+ minutes, which while it was way too long, it was still awesome to see all the data being pushed into a database.</p>

<p>The Dragonflies started yesterday and they seem to be doing quite well. One pair was already doing Battleship which I dont think anyone in THE PLAGUE* had done on the first day.</p>

<p>*Formally known as the Grasshoppers</p>
