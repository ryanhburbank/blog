    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are nearing the end of Phase 1, and I am moving ahead to Phase 2 Monday.</p>

<p>I am so pumped.</p>

<p>It sounds like we lost a few people which is too. I expected we would lose a few people and to be honest I kinda expected we would lose more but I am glad people we able to make it.</p>

<p>Tonight we had the creator of Selenium for speaker night which was pretty cool. He talked a lot about the robot he made that could manually test iOS and Android apps on actual devices, which is pretty awesome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the beginning of week 3 in Phase 1. We are supposed to be learning Databases and Active Record, and I am pretty excited about that.</p>

<p>Update on Week 3 Phase 1:</p>

<p>We have looked at Databases and Active Record a bit but not a whole log. SQL queries are pretty fun and now we have been implementing them into ruby programs which is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Today was the assessment to see if we move on to Phase 2, and I made it. I was super nervous last night even though I didnt feel like I had a reason to, I also interviewed with Mike which was pretty cool, he questioned a lot of my code and even though it really put me on the spot I really appreciated it.</p>

<p>Im looking forward to Phase 2 so much, I just wanna build awesome shit every day.</p>

    <id>http://zacholauson.github.io/blog/blog/2013/07/06/a-few-things-about-dbc-chicago</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first started this blog I wanted to write a bit about the Chicago DBC as a whole, because when I got accepted they hadnt even opened their doors for the Squirrels yet ( first cohort ). So unlike the DBC in San Francisco you couldnt look up anything you wanted about the place and have a ton of sources of info. So I kinda wanted to do that for DBC Chicago, even though no one reads this, maybe someone looking for answers will find it, and it will be helpful.</p>

<h4>Food &amp;&amp; Drink</h4>

<p>A lot of people go out to eat at lunch, you have a hour and a half.During Week 1 I ate out almost every day for lunch and dinner and was feeling pretty shitty so now I am trying to bring food or go back to my apartment and eat but its cool to try to places. There is a fridge for boots and each boot has a box for other food.</p>

<p>Merchandise Mart is just across the street, and they have a pretty good selection of things.</p>

<p>There is 2 Subways within a block and beyond that there is quite a large selection.</p>

<p>In the Kitchen at DBC there is 2 coffee makers, 1 of which is a Keurig, so bring your cup things if you want that, I havent used either but there is almost always coffee available, before 3 I think.</p>

<p>There is also a Starbucks in the main floor of the building and a CVS right across the street for other drinks or snacks.</p>

<p>Also theres a bar / burger place on the main floor but the 1 time I went there because I wanted a burger they were out of burgers, so I no longer will go there.</p>

<h4>Apartments / Housing</h4>

<p>I was really lucky and ended up getting a apartment a block away from DBC with a fellow Grasshopper, and honestly, its awesome. Its not overly expensive and the convience of living so close is worth any extra to me. Also Trader Joes and Whole Foods arent that far away which is pretty nice for groceries.</p>

<p>Besides that I guess I would just check for sublets on craigslist or something, I think some other guys are trying to get a list together of places near by so I will link to that in the future if it happens.</p>

<h4>Hours?</h4>

<p>The core hours are 8 to 5 ( you check in with your group at 7:45 ) after that you are free to leave but its a great work enviroment, everyone is super helpful, and you will have stuff to do.</p>

<p>I usually get there at about 7:30ish and leave around 10ish sometimes later, depending if I have to get groceries or do laundry.</p>

<p>Weekends are optional but you still have work to do so if you dont come in you will still have to put in some good hours of work. Weekends get a little louder than core hours during the week so I suggest headphones if you need the quiet.</p>

<h4>Work Enviroment</h4>

<p>This is my favorite part about DBC, its a great place to work and everyone is amazing. I have never felt so excited to go somewhere at 7:30 in the morning. Its pretty cool to think that, at any given minute in that place, someone is making something awesome.</p>

<p>Originally I kinda figured it would be wierd, being the n00bs in phase 1 but everyone has been there and everyone is super helpful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well it appears I finally figured out how to get my posts to not have a title.</p>

<p>I just have to rake new post with a title ( currently using the date ) and then just replaces the title with a space, you have to leave the title tag and put a space otherwise it defaults to your file name.</p>

<p>We are only about a week away from Phase 2, I am feeling really good about Phase 1 but I wont know until Thursday. Alyssa said that if they havent mentioned to us that we are in danger of &ldquo;failing&rdquo; then we are all good, but I guess I like to worry.</p>

So I kinda wanted to do that for DBC Chicago, even though no one reads this, maybe someone looking for answers will find it helpful. The next post will be that and if someone does find this and needs more answers, you can email me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Im so exhausted today, luckily the flash cards exercise for today doesnt seem too complex, and I think its a group project so that will be cool.</p>

<p>Im really hoping we dont get stuck in a super boring lecture today, I really wish they could be optional, I dont like wasteing time when only a few people cant get it.</p>

<p>Also testing another no title post.</p>
