    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel like week one is going really well so far. Today we are tackling Sudoku which I dont currently have any ideas for but we have about a hour until that would be a issue anyways. Yesterday Ryan and I paired and we got a lot of work done and solved some cool problems, which was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The speaker last night was incredible. Hands down my favorite speaker Ive ever heard. He was funny and he was talking about topics we all cared about, which was awesome. He was the lead ( I think ) for the Mozilla Badges project and really gave me a lot to think about. He never stayed at a single job for more than 2 years, just because the job he was at wouldnt let him try to technologies, or old, that he wanted to play with learn, which is awesome that he just was learning so much.</p>

<p>&mdash;&ndash; Im going to continue this post today (Saturday, didnt get a chance to finish yesterday &mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p>Yesterday was one one of my least favorite days in my recent memory. We did a Sudoku solver as a group and our group dynamic did not work. I was so mentaly, just dead, I left right at 5 and just went to lay down for a bit. I couldnt even think.</p>

<p>Today, I am going to work on the weekend cores, which there isnt a whole lot then I am going to try to work on the chat app that Brett and I built last Sunday.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was my second day at DevBootcamp in Chicago. It was simply awesome.</p>

<h4>Pairing</h4>

<p>We paired with the same person all day today and my pair ended up being Brett, and the pair programming experience was really good. I just kept my hands away from the keyboard and mouse while navigating so I wouldnt accidently take control when my brain started going, and when I did take over, I asked first so I wasnt stepping on any toes.</p>

<h4>Mentors</h4>

<p>We met our mentors tonight, my mentor is Rob Lambert, who is a java developer. I&rsquo;m not sure what mentors provide to us, but its cool that people are willing to give up some of their day to help us beginners out.</p>

<h4>A Bit of Badassery</h4>

<p>Today was pretty badass, since Brett and I were pretty productive we had a bit of extra time so I helped some people out, which was really cool to be able to help others instead of only asking for help, which we also had to do because regular expressions are crazy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So.. Pair Programming.</p>

<p>Today was my first real shot at it. Im not sure what to think of it, but I am sure that if we are learning how to do it properly, its good.
I thought it was pretty good, at some points and it was mostly dependant on who I was pairing with. Some people it really was pretty good, but then a couple it was just eh, and I dont blame anyone but myself.</p>

<p>I am so used to working on my own and in my own little zone, when I see a possibility of improving the code or something I just jump on the keyboard and starting layin down code. Which certainly isnt how pair programming works.</p>

<p>Ill keep posting on pair programming as I get better / or worse at it. I would really like to get really understand, sooner than later, so I dont hurt my partners learning while pairing, but for now we are all new to it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So today was my first day at DevBootcamp Chicago. I am not sure how to describe it, so Ill just use a single word: Badass. Everyone is super nice and so pumped to be here, its nuts.</p>

<p>This morning our group was welcomed by a man with a pretty cool mustache in short jean shorts and a guy in strobing sun glasses. It threw me off a bit.</p>

<p>Then when we walked into the front door, we walked through a tunnel of screaming people, one of the more terrifying moments of my life.</p>

<p>Most of the morning consisted of talks about what we will be doing and different stuff while we are here.</p>

<p>We did get to start a bit of coding today, which was fun, we got to do pair programming, which I am not so sure on, I will make a seperate post including my thoughts and whatnot on that as a beginner after I send this one out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well we are only about 30 minutes away from starting. I am not sure what to say, just I am excited and nervous and I cant wait to start diving into some code.</p>

<p>I am not sure if blogging counts as social networking while I am there, so I may just have to write a post tonight about all that I have learned.</p>

<p>As I get more used to the place I want to write about the experience at the Chicago office, because when I applied it hadnt even opened and I havent been able to find much info about it, where as the San Francisco office, you can pretty much find out whatever you want to know from a blog post or two.</p>
