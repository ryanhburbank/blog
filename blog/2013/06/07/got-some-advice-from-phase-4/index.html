	<div class="entry-content"><h3>Today I talked to Stephen Nguyen, who is in Phase 4 at DBC. He was doing a Google Hangout where anyone could come in and ask questions or just hangout.</h3>

<h3>Heres his blog if you wish to check it out <a href="http://binaryskipper.tumblr.com/">http://binaryskipper.tumblr.com/</a></h3>

<p>So I didnt go in with any specific questions, just thought I would hangout and hopefully chat about code. He gave me some pretty cool info about some plugins for Sublime, such as Bracket Highlighter, Emmet, and SublimeLinter, which all can be found in Package Control.</p>

<p>He also gave me some tips on getting even more prepared for DBC. He said there were some books I should probably check out like &ldquo;Eloquent Ruby&rdquo; (which I have been reading and its awesome), &ldquo;Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sinatra Up and Running&rdquo;. He also said that doing the exercises in Chris Pine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Learn to Program&rdquo; was very important, he said many people just read through the book and didnt really get all they could take away from the book, he said a lot of the Exercises are similar or the same as their Week 1 challenges, which I am not sure if SF and Chicagos exercises are the same but still good info.</p>

<p>Also he recommended to play around with SQL tables, and play around with Sinatra and Rails, although we wont need Rails until Phase 3 but it would be good to be somewhat familiar.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;m thankful he took the time out of his day to do this for the DBC community, he gave me a lot of helpful tips and I feel a little bit better about were I am in prep.</p>
