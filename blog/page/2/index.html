		<time>02 July 2013</time>

		<div class="content">
			<p>So week one was nuts. Not as extreme of a workload as I expected, but theres always been something to be done. Week 2 is Object Oriented Programming, which I am really looking forward to. Im not super good with classes but I have a pretty good understanding so hopefully I get paired today with someone who can explain it a little more as we work.</p>

<p>Yesterday we did Engineering Empathy, which I didnt hate, but its certainly not part of what I am used to, but I have been trying to get out of my comfort zone while I am here so that certainly did it.</p>

<p>Also yesterday we had Improv night, which was also nuts. That also got me out of my comfort zone. The instructor was very nice and he had us doing cool stuff, I just wasnt into it. I much rather would have been coding for that 3 hours but I get why they have us do it, so thats cool.</p>

<p>I got thinking yesterday about some cool shit I could build in Sinatra, even though I dont know Sinatra, but in my spare time these next two weeks I could probably learn Sinatra.</p>

<p>I would like to explore the idea of building the following:</p>

<p>Cards Against Humanity
Online version of our chatroom</p>

<p>And I had a few more ideas but of course I cant think of them&hellip;</p>

<p>I dont want to spend too much time doing that though because if I have extra time I should be helping others who are having a more difficult time with the material we are covering, not only because I want them to succeed but also it will help me understand the concepts I am trying to explain. Also I want to make sure I have a pretty good understanding before I try to explain something because I would hate to explain something wrong and them think its right from now on.</p>

		<time>28 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I feel like week one is going really well so far. Today we are tackling Sudoku which I dont currently have any ideas for but we have about a hour until that would be a issue anyways. Yesterday Ryan and I paired and we got a lot of work done and solved some cool problems, which was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The speaker last night was incredible. Hands down my favorite speaker Ive ever heard. He was funny and he was talking about topics we all cared about, which was awesome. He was the lead ( I think ) for the Mozilla Badges project and really gave me a lot to think about. He never stayed at a single job for more than 2 years, just because the job he was at wouldnt let him try to technologies, or old, that he wanted to play with learn, which is awesome that he just was learning so much.</p>

<p>&mdash;&ndash; Im going to continue this post today (Saturday, didnt get a chance to finish yesterday &mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p>Yesterday was one one of my least favorite days in my recent memory. We did a Sudoku solver as a group and our group dynamic did not work. I was so mentaly, just dead, I left right at 5 and just went to lay down for a bit. I couldnt even think.</p>

<p>Today, I am going to work on the weekend cores, which there isnt a whole lot then I am going to try to work on the chat app that Brett and I built last Sunday.</p>

		<time>25 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Today was my second day at DevBootcamp in Chicago. It was simply awesome.</p>

<h4>Pairing</h4>

<p>We paired with the same person all day today and my pair ended up being Brett, and the pair programming experience was really good. I just kept my hands away from the keyboard and mouse while navigating so I wouldnt accidently take control when my brain started going, and when I did take over, I asked first so I wasnt stepping on any toes.</p>

<h4>Mentors</h4>

<p>We met our mentors tonight, my mentor is Rob Lambert, who is a java developer. I&rsquo;m not sure what mentors provide to us, but its cool that people are willing to give up some of their day to help us beginners out.</p>

<h4>A Bit of Badassery</h4>

<p>Today was pretty badass, since Brett and I were pretty productive we had a bit of extra time so I helped some people out, which was really cool to be able to help others instead of only asking for help, which we also had to do because regular expressions are crazy.</p>

		<time>24 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>So.. Pair Programming.</p>

<p>Today was my first real shot at it. Im not sure what to think of it, but I am sure that if we are learning how to do it properly, its good.
I thought it was pretty good, at some points and it was mostly dependant on who I was pairing with. Some people it really was pretty good, but then a couple it was just eh, and I dont blame anyone but myself.</p>

<p>I am so used to working on my own and in my own little zone, when I see a possibility of improving the code or something I just jump on the keyboard and starting layin down code. Which certainly isnt how pair programming works.</p>

<p>Ill keep posting on pair programming as I get better / or worse at it. I would really like to get really understand, sooner than later, so I dont hurt my partners learning while pairing, but for now we are all new to it.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>So today was my first day at DevBootcamp Chicago. I am not sure how to describe it, so Ill just use a single word: Badass. Everyone is super nice and so pumped to be here, its nuts.</p>

<p>This morning our group was welcomed by a man with a pretty cool mustache in short jean shorts and a guy in strobing sun glasses. It threw me off a bit.</p>

<p>Then when we walked into the front door, we walked through a tunnel of screaming people, one of the more terrifying moments of my life.</p>

<p>Most of the morning consisted of talks about what we will be doing and different stuff while we are here.</p>

<p>We did get to start a bit of coding today, which was fun, we got to do pair programming, which I am not so sure on, I will make a seperate post including my thoughts and whatnot on that as a beginner after I send this one out.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>Well we are only about 30 minutes away from starting. I am not sure what to say, just I am excited and nervous and I cant wait to start diving into some code.</p>

<p>I am not sure if blogging counts as social networking while I am there, so I may just have to write a post tonight about all that I have learned.</p>

<p>As I get more used to the place I want to write about the experience at the Chicago office, because when I applied it hadnt even opened and I havent been able to find much info about it, where as the San Francisco office, you can pretty much find out whatever you want to know from a blog post or two.</p>

		<time>24 June 2013</time>

		<div class="content">
			<p>So tomorrow&rsquo;s the day that will be the beginning of my time at DevBootcamp. I&rsquo;m so excited and nervous at the same time I am not sure what to even say about it.  I went to dinner tonight with ~10 of the people in my cohort (The Grasshoppers) which was fun.</p>

<p>Also today, which I am pretty proud of / excited about, Brett and I made a chat client created in Ruby using a service called PubNub for instant updating. Its coming a long pretty nicely, and we only have a few hours into which is unbelievable to me. We havent really been pair programming because we have been using both our computers but working a long side each other, which has really sped up everything we have been working on so far. We also uploaded it to github and we are going to give version control a try, instead of just sharing gists to keep each other on the same path.</p>

<p>You can check that out here :
<a href="https://github.com/zacholauson/pubnub_chatroom">https://github.com/zacholauson/pubnub_chatroom</a></p>

<p>Here is his github page:
<a href="https://github.com/brettsanders">https://github.com/brettsanders</a></p>

<p>We have to be there at 7:50 and the doors open at 8, we got a email from Dave (Dave Hoover) on Saturday letting us know what to do, and it really didnt answer a whole lot, which I know it wasnt supposed to.</p>

<p>Anyways, as I was told to, to my family &amp;&amp; friends:</p>

<p>  &ldquo;I am moving to Nepal to find inner peace.
   I like a few of you. That is all.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>This morning my mom was driving through Chicago so I went and had breakfast with her, and then coded a bit, then Brett and I decided to go get groceries and we ended up exploring Chicago a bit, we went to the top of the John Hancock building and took some cool pictures, I played around with Photosphere and then we went and looked at some beautiful cars at a, dare I say, Super / Hyper Car dealership. Cars are so beautiful, even the shitty ones still have a little something that makes them nice. Not sure if I should admit I feel that way though, some cars are so ugly.</p>

<p>Tonight we are working on making that One &ndash; Dice &ndash; Roll game multiplayer in the sense that you could controll it from 2 or more different computers, we started with sockets but we cant get it to communicate properly.</p>

<p>I suggested we set up something like port forwarding so we could use external IP&rsquo;s to connect to each other, and I think that would work, but we arent getting it.</p>

<p>So now were kinda reverse engineering multiplayer games built in Ruby to figure out what makes a server and client app communicate.</p>

<p>Also just over 1 day until DevBootcamp starts.</p>

<p>We so excited and it ain&rsquo;t even Friday.</p>

			<p>Well we are only 2 days away from starting DevBootcamp. I am feeling much better about where I am, and I think I am pretty well prepared, only time will tell though.</p>

<p>Last night, Brett (who is my roomate and also a Grasshopper) and I were working on a One Die Game from rubyquiz, we ended up using Nitrous.IO to collaborate over a couple text files and we made a lot of progress last night. We still need to implement computer logic so you can play against AI. We also took it a step further and starting making it so you could specify who many players you wanted and how many of them would be humans, so you could play against 20+ computers (probably wouldnt be very fun) or play vs a friend or something.</p>

			<p>Alright everything seemed to work except for the link to the blog post, I think it was getting thrown off because I have it on a github project page called /blog and individual posts are also stored in /blog folder when deployed so its:</p>
